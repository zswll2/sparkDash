## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Custom prefill size** — type any token count from 256–300k in the prefill benchmark (plus the preset chips).
- **q27 LLM backend** — detect signalnine/q27 via `/v1/models` ownership or `q27_*` Prometheus series; report backend-aware decode/prefill rates and inference-health telemetry.
- **Hide worker nodes** — Settings toggle. Worker-role Sparks drop off Overview cards and the tab bar (the open worker tab stays). Direct URLs and batch Wake / Shutdown / Hermes still include them.
- **On-demand Remote bench** — a **Remote** button next to decode/prefill opens a host + port (HTTPS) field. Paste a Tailscale URL such as `https://name.ts.net/v1/models`; nothing is probed until you run Decode or Prefill against it.
- **Decode / prefill benches on remote Sparks** — if the remote LLM is not reachable on its LAN IP (loopback-only bind), sparkDash opens an SSH local-forward to `127.0.0.1:<port>` for the job. Bench buttons stay on the LLM card even when the live probe shows no model.
- **Benchmark share image** — the decode/prefill **Copy results** button is now a split button: the label copies the text summary as before, and the caret on its right offers **Copy as text** / **Copy as image** on hover or click. The image is a 1200×675-or-taller card drawn in the app's dark palette with the sparkDash mark, the unit, the model, one row per level and the same legend the dialog shows. On by default (Settings → **Benchmark share image** turns it off, restoring the plain text button); it copies where the page has an image clipboard — HTTPS or localhost — and otherwise downloads the PNG, and says so in the menu rather than pretending.
- **Single-account sign-in + self-signed HTTPS** — a LAN bind is no longer an open API. `npm run auth:init -- admin` writes a scrypt account to `config/auth.json` (mode 0600); the browser signs in through an `HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Strict` session cookie with per-IP lockout (5 failures → 15 min), uniform `Invalid credentials` errors, an origin check on every write, and the same session on `/ws`. `TLS_ENABLED=1` (default) serves HTTPS/WSS from `config/tls` (`npm run tls:gen`), and a non-loopback bind with neither an account nor `SPARKDASH_TOKEN` now fails closed at startup. New env: `TLS_ENABLED`, `TLS_CERT_PATH`, `TLS_KEY_PATH`, `SPARKDASH_AUTH_JSON`, `SESSION_TTL_MS`, `LOGIN_MAX_FAILS`, `LOGIN_LOCK_MS`.
- **Account from the environment** — a fresh deployment needs two lines instead of the interactive setup: `SPARKDASH_ADMIN_USER` + `SPARKDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (from `npm run auth:hash`, the same value works on every host that should share the login). The plaintext `SPARKDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is the convenience path: it seeds `config/auth.json` (mode 0600) on first start, warns in the startup log, and is meant to be deleted once the hash is in place. `config/auth.json` always wins while it exists. `.gitignore` also now blocks `.env.*` variants (keeping `.env.example`), `config/auth.json*`, password files, `*.key`, `*.pem` and `*.bak`.

### Fixed
- **Decode bench “Too many benchmark requests”** — start quota was 6/min stacked with a 2/min cooldown, and failed retries still burned the quota. Starts are now 20/min, cooldown is 3s (double-click only), and 400/409 responses do not count.
- **Decode bench 24×/32× work budget ([#93](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/93))** — the post-1.8.6 security cap (131k total tokens) rejected a full concurrency sweep at 2048 max tokens. The cap is 262k so every advertised level fits.
- **Prefill bench still dying at ~5 min** — Node undici aborts streams with no headers/body after 300s. Long prefills now use an Agent with those idle timeouts disabled; the per-size AbortSignal remains the bound.
- **SGLang live Prefill tok/s latching ([#99](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/99))** — the poll picked its Prometheus applier from the *displayed* rates, so a non-zero prefill kept selecting the cache-split path (which by design never writes `prefillTps`) and the value could not return to 0. Which applier runs now depends on whether `/server_info` carries `total_*` counters on that poll. The token baseline is also seeded outside the rate window, so the first poll after a restart no longer turns the engine's lifetime prompt counter into a rate.
- **`SPARKDASH_TOKEN` never reached the container ([#86](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/86))** — the compose file did not pass it through, so a `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` install failed closed no matter what `.env` said. The empty default still reads as "no token".
- **Tailscale addresses classified as public ([#89](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/89))** — `100.64.0.0/10`, where a tailnet lives, now reads as LAN on the endpoint-exposure indicator.
- **SGLang served model ID ([#95](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/95))** — the panel and the bench requests use the id from `/v1/models` (what the server accepts), keeping the native storage path on `modelPath`.
- **Remote SSH session churn** — collectors reuse an authenticated SSH transport instead of creating a full SSH/PAM login for every metric poll. `SSH_CONTROL_PERSIST_SECONDS=0` restores one connection per command if needed.

---

## [1.8.6] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Prefill benchmark** — sequential context-size sweep (1k–300k) measuring prefill tok/s (`prompt_tokens` ÷ TTFT) and TTFT. Unique prefix per size so prefix-cache does not inflate later runs. Button on the LLM card; persisted last run. Per-size timeout scales with context (90s floor, ~8 ms/token, 45 min cap).
- **DGX Spark CPU temperature** — remote Sparks collect CPU temp over SSH with the same hwmon allowlist as hosts (`acpitz` / `coretemp` / `k10temp` / `zenpower`; NVMe / CX7 filtered out). Overview shows a CPU bar and Spark pages show a CPU row on the GPU panel when the reading is above 0°C.

### Fixed
- **Prefill bench 256k timeout** — per-size cap was 12 minutes (`~3 ms/token`); slow prefills aborted before first token. Now ~8 ms/token with a 45 minute cap, and the error names the limit.
- **Copy results tok/s** — clipboard text now uses one decimal like the decode-bench table (`31.5` not `31`), and TTFT uses the same mean as the table. ([#57](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/57))
- **SGLang log spam** — probe current `/server_info` and `/model_info` first; keep the deprecated `/get_*` aliases as fallback so old servers still work. ([#52](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/52))

---

## [1.8.5] — 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- **Decode type picker defaults to Structured** — opening the sheet (or loading a previous run) no longer leaves Prose/Code/JSON selected. A still-running job still shows its type.
- **Code workload was prose-speed** — the LRU + "thorough comments" prompt is English with `def` sprinkled in, so DFlash2 accept matched Prose. Code is now `clamp_00`…`clamp_49` identical-shape Python helpers, no comments.

---

## [1.8.4] — 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Decode benchmark type picker** — choose **Structured** (default, count 1→200), **Prose** (lab hash-map explanation), **Code** (fixed LRU-cache Python prompt), or **JSON** (GPU-metrics catalog) before Run. Labels are output types only — no `response_format`, grammars, or guided JSON. Same lab protocol for every type: temp 0, `top_p` 1, thinking off, 32-token warmup, default 400 tokens. The selected type is shown on results and in copied summaries.

---

## [1.8.3] — 2026-08-28

### Changed
- **Decode benchmark uses the lab structured protocol** — count 1→200 (numbers only) instead of the Showcase JSON/YAML catalog + fill-to-max. Temperature **0**, `top_p` **1**, thinking **off**, 32-token warmup, default max tokens **400**. Concurrency 1 is the same prompt as glm-5.3-flash-sm120 `tests/bench_decode.py --structured`; concurrent streams get a unique suffix so they do not share a prefix-cache block.
- **Thinking flags default off** — GLM / Qwen / MiniMax think unless the request disables it. `applyThinkingFlags` now defaults to off and always sends `enable_thinking`, `thinking`, and `thinking_mode`. HTTP 400 retries keep an explicit off payload instead of stripping flags (stripping lets hybrid models think by default). Showcase treats a missing thinking flag as off.

---

## [1.8.2] — 2026-08-23

### Added
- **EXL3 live tok/s** — detect ExLlamaV3 `tools/serve_openai.py` (`owned_by: exl3` or `/health` `{ok, busy}`) instead of mislabeling it as vLLM. Generation and prefill tok/s come from `/health` cumulative token counters (no Prometheus `/metrics`).
- **Tailnet monitoring** — opt-in per unit (`tailscaleMonitoring`, default **off**); `tailscale status --json` on the host and a Tailnet card under Resources. Flags a unit that is healthy on the LAN but off its tailnet. ([#43](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/43))
- **NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY on the GPU panel** — count of NVRM `NV_ERR_NO_MEMORY` kernel log lines since boot (shown when > 0). Journal is scanned at most once a minute, not on the 2s poll. Replaces the approach in [#40](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/40).

### Security
- **`BIND_HOST` now defaults to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) instead of `0.0.0.0`** — the dashboard is unauthenticated and can SSH into and power off Sparks, so it is no longer reachable on the LAN by default. Set `BIND_HOST` to the host's LAN IP (or `0.0.0.0`) to opt in to remote access. **Migration:** if you access sparkDash from another machine via bare-metal `npm start`, set `BIND_HOST` explicitly. Production and dev Compose both set `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` (`network_mode: host`). Startup now also warns when bound to a non-loopback address. ([#35](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/35))

### Fixed
- Decode bench `POST /api/sparks/:id/llm/bench` rejects LLM ports that are not in the Spark's configured list (same allowlist as showcase). ([#45](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/45))
- **Host CPU temperature** — dedicated GPU hosts (`kind: host`) show CPU temp on the RAM panel and Overview (hidden at 0°C / no sensor). Remote hosts now read hwmon/thermal over SSH. DGX Sparks still do not display CPU temp (remote Sparks still skip the extra sensor SSH). ([#34](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/34))

### Changed
- Docker Node base image pulls from `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/node` so Spark builds do not fail on Docker Hub IPv6 `auth.docker.io` / “network is unreachable”. `deploy.sh` prints that workaround if a build still fails.
- README architecture diagram top border aligned with the box. ([#39](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/39))

---

## [1.8.1] — 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Daily LLM tok/s history** — busy-sample rollups (peak + mean) for decode and prefill, persisted in `config/llm-daily.json` (30 UTC days). 14-day peak chart on the LLM card; `GET /api/sparks/:id/llm/daily`.
- **Cached vs uncached prefill tok/s** — live rows when the backend splits kinds: ds4 labeled prefill counters, llama.cpp `/slots` `n_prompt_tokens_cache`, SGLang `sglang:cached_tokens_total` (L1 `cache_source="device"`). Combined Prefill stays computed/uncached. vLLM is unchanged (combined prefill + prefix-cache hit rate).

### Changed
- **Docker SSH key auth** — compose comments + README: key auth runs inside the container (`/root/.ssh`), not the host user’s `~/.ssh`. Custom-named keys must be mounted as `id_ed25519` (or set `SSH_IDENTITY_FILE`). LAN IPs are from the sparkDash host. Add/Edit Spark hint when auth is Key.

### Fixed
- SGLang `/metrics` no longer overwrites `/get_server_info` tok/s when both are present.
- llama.cpp `n_prompt_tokens_processed: 0` is not treated as missing (fully cached prompts).

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Non-Spark unit support** (`kind: "host"`) — dedicated GPU hosts (any Linux box with an NVIDIA GPU, e.g. a workstation with an RTX card) are first-class units: added from the **+** button (choose **Dedicated GPU host**), monitored via SSH + `nvidia-smi` exactly like a Spark, but never labeled as a DGX Spark.
- **Detected host hardware** — for `kind: "host"`, the header shows real hardware detected once when online (GPU model, CUDA driver, CPU model/cores, system RAM) instead of fixed GB10 specs.
- **Separate system RAM vs discrete VRAM** — for host units, VRAM comes straight from `nvidia-smi` (`memory.used` / `memory.total`, free = total − used) while system RAM is read from `/proc/meminfo`. Spark behavior is unchanged (GB10 unified HBM pool).
- **RAM panel + Overview RAM bar** — host unit pages get a dedicated RAM panel, and Overview cards show a RAM bar under VRAM for hosts.
- **Host Resources layout** — host unit pages stack **RAM → Network → Storage** in the right column with **GPU** filling the left column (Sparks keep the original layout). CX7 IP is hidden for hosts (Spark-specific NIC).
- **Prefill tok/s** (moved from Unreleased) — live LLM panel sparkline, Overview cards as two columns (**tok/s** | **prefill**), decode-bench **Prefill** column (`prompt_tokens` ÷ TTFT).
- **Live prefill measurement** — vLLM uses engine-step `iteration_tokens_total` surplus over generation (so a short/cached prefill that lands in the same poll as the first decode tokens still counts); prompt/TTFT counters are the fallback because they often only move at first token. ds4 uses computed (not cached) prefill token diffs. Idle returns to 0. Opening a saved chat in the UI does not hit the GPU; prefill is the prompt/KV pass when you send or regenerate.

### Changed
- **Decode benchmark matches Showcase structural** — same prompt catalog and fill-to-max shaping (`min_tokens` / `ignore_eos` / fill suffix); no 4k unique prefill prefix. Temperature **0**, thinking **off** (Showcase defaults are temp 0.7 and thinking off). Default max tokens 512.
- **Update Hermes button is now a permanent, neutral control** — no more toast notifications for Hermes updates. It turns warning-yellow and shows a commit-count badge **only when an update is actually available**; clicking it opens the update dialog (status / pending commits / release notes) as before.
- **Overview "Update Hermes" button** (formerly "Update All") follows the same rule — neutral by default, warning-yellow with a pending-count badge only when ≥1 monitored Spark has an update available. Pressing it now shows a **live progress bar** (x/y Sparks settled, driven by WS per-Spark update status) until every started update finishes.

### Fixed
- **Decode benchmark "Benchmark not found" mid-run** — running jobs lived only in memory, so a `node --watch` / SIGTERM reload dropped them and the dialog poll hit 404. Active benches are now checkpointed to `config/bench-active.json`, finalized on shutdown, and recovered as interrupted on boot; the dialog also recovers via the list endpoint instead of showing a bare 404.

### Removed
- **Toast system** (`useToasts.ts`, `useHermesAlerts.ts`, `components/ui/Toaster.tsx`) — Hermes notifications now live entirely on the header button instead of pop-up toasts.

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Hermes Agent service per Spark** — opt-in `hermesMonitoring` toggle in Edit Spark; when on, sparkDash treats the Hermes Agent CLI (nousresearch/hermes-agent) as installed on that machine
- **Update notifications** — background `hermes update --check` poll (10 min) per monitored Spark; a toast alerts when an update is available
- **One-click update** — `Update Hermes` button in the Spark header and in the update alert toast; runs `hermes update` over SSH (non-interactive), with running/success/error state streamed over WS
- **Hermes status in snapshot** — installed / version / updateAvailable / behindCommits / checkedAt / job status per Spark (`snapshot.hermes`)
- **Toast system** — minimal built-in toast store + Toaster component (no new dependency), reused for Hermes alerts
- **Update confirmation dialog with real content** — clicking Update Hermes (header button or alert toast) opens a modal with **Update now** / **Cancel**. When the update is only commits on `main` (no newer tagged release than what is installed), it shows the **actual pending commits** from git (`HEAD..origin/main`) instead of the latest-release changelog — the full release changelog is shown only when a real version bump exists
- **`GET /api/sparks/:id/hermes/updates`** — update preview: latest release (cached) + installed version + **real pending commits** from git on the Spark + a resolved view; the old `/api/hermes/releases/latest` is superseded
- **Update All** — `POST /api/sparks/hermes/update-all` + Overview button runs `hermes update` on every Spark with Hermes Agent enabled (per-spark start/skip/fail summary; per-spark progress still streamed over WS)
- **`POST /api/sparks/:id/hermes/check`** (force check now) and **`POST /api/sparks/:id/hermes/update`** (background job, 202)

### Changed
- `hermesMonitoring` normalized in Spark config; server boots HermesProbe only when enabled (all roles, local + remote)
- Toast stack renders above modals at `z-index: 10000`

### Fixed
- **Local Spark Hermes runs as the wrong user (root), corrupting the install** — hermes + its git repo belong to the host user, but the local path executed hermes as the container root. That produced git "dubious ownership" failures and, once worked around, wrote root-owned files into the user's tree (tools/*.py, uv.lock, …) and ran `uv pip install` as root — which failed and left `venv/bin/hermes` missing, breaking the `hermes` CLI entirely. The local path now resolves the host user from the host passwd bind mount and drops to that user via `setpriv` (`nsenter` + host mount ns so host git is visible), with a self-healing root-owned-file repair step. Remote SSH already ran as the real user.
- **Broken launcher detection + auto-repair** — when the `hermes` launcher exists but cannot execute (e.g. missing venv entry point), sparkDash now reports "broken install" instead of a false "no update" and the one-click update automatically rebuilds the venv entry point (`uv pip install -e .`), then retries.
- **Stale git lock bricks later updates** — an interrupted `hermes update` can leave `.git/shallow.lock` (or any `*.lock`) behind, making every later fetch fail; leftover `*.lock` files are cleared before each check/update.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- **ComfyUI monitoring** — opt-in per Spark (`comfyMonitoring`, default port **8188**); Edit Spark checkbox + inline port field; connectivity Test includes ComfyUI when enabled
- **ComfyUI probe** — `GET /system_stats` + `GET /queue` (job-centric card; no host RAM/VRAM duplicate of GPU/CPU panels)
- **Active / queued jobs** — workflow title, model weight names from the graph, footprint (resolution · steps · sampler · batch · node count)
- **Live progress** — Comfy WebSocket when events are available; elapsed/avg-duration estimate otherwise; progress bar on the running job
- **Last finished job** — status + duration from `/api/jobs` (with `/history` fallback)
- **Cancel / remove** — `POST /api/sparks/:id/comfy/cancel` to interrupt a running job or dequeue a pending one from the card
- **Open ComfyUI** — deep link to `http://{lanIp}:{comfyPort}` (LAN IP preferred over localhost for remote browsers)
- **Overview Comfy chip** — `Comfy · idle` / `run` / `Nq` / muted when unreachable (only when monitoring is on)
- **Model inventory** — checkpoints + LoRAs from `/models/*` (section hidden when both lists are empty)
- **Queue ETA** — estimate from recent job durations × pending (+ progress remainder when known)
- **Collapsible sections** — **Resources** (GPU / CPU / Storage / Network) and **Services** (LLM / ComfyUI); open state persisted in `localStorage`
- **Services layout** — primary LLM + ComfyUI side-by-side when both enabled; +1 extra LLM full-width; +2 extras as a pair; odd leftover full-width

### Changed
- **Compact UI is the default** layout density (`density: "compact"` in settings + CSS/`data-density`); comfortable remains available via Settings
- Spark snapshot includes **`lanIp`** / **`isLocal`** for client deep-links

### Fixed
- Comfy progress WebSocket soft-reconnects on host/port change (no longer permanently closed after `setTarget`)

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **GPU thermal throttle meter** — collect NVIDIA `clocks_throttle_reasons` (HW/SW thermal, HW slowdown, SW power cap) plus SM current/max clocks via `nvidia-smi` (local and remote)
- **GPU panel Throttle row** — status chip (`OK` / `Thermal` / `Power` / `HW`) with SM clock bar and tooltip of active reasons
- **Overview thermal hint** — compact red “Thermal throttle” banner when any Spark reports thermal slowdown

---

## [1.4.7] — 2026-08-02

### Added
- **SGLang and DwarfStar (ds4-server) properly supported in LLM probes** — correct backend detection, model/context, and live tok/s for both engines alongside vLLM and llama.cpp
- **ds4-server / DwarfStar LLM probe** — auto-detect Entrpi/ds4-on-spark via `owned_by: ds4.c` or Prometheus `ds4_*` series; model/`context_length` from `/v1/models`; live tok/s from `ds4_tokens_*` counter diffs
- **`llmProbeHost`** — local Sparks probe `127.0.0.1` so loopback-bound servers (ds4 `start.sh` default `--host 127.0.0.1`) are reachable; Showcase / Decode bench / connectivity test use the same host
- **Docker host networking** — compose uses `network_mode: host` so the container can reach host loopback LLM ports

### Fixed
- **SGLang tok/s stuck at 0** — modern SGLang without `total_*_tokens` / `--enable-metrics` now reads `internal_states[].last_gen_throughput`
- **SGLang sticky ~30 tok/s when idle** — only treat `last_gen_throughput` as live after it changes between polls; expire to 0 when it stops moving
- **ds4 window-gauge idle bleed** — do not use `ds4_decode_tok_s` / `ds4_prefill_tok_s` (~60s averages) for the live panel

### Changed
- Backend badge / types include **ds4**; overview labels distinguish ds4 / sgLang / vLLM

---

## [1.4.5] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- **SGLang detection** — OpenAI-compatible servers are no longer always labeled vLLM; SGLang is identified via `owned_by` / `/get_server_info`, and HF hub cache model paths are shortened to `org/name` ([#29](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/29))
- **Overview model name trim** — long LLM / worker labels wrap instead of ellipsis-truncating in the stats grid

### Changed
- **Decode benchmark concurrencies** — added 5, 10, 12, and 24 ([#27](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/27))
- **LLM API key port renames** — keys migrate/prune when ports change; rejected keys show “Bad API key” ([#26](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/26))

---

## [1.4.4] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Optional per-port LLM API key** — set a Bearer token in LLM panel Settings for OpenAI-compatible gateways (e.g. LiteLLM); stored encrypted like SSH passwords; used by probe, Showcase, and Decode bench ([#21](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/21))

### Changed
- **Settings version label** — reads `package.json` version instead of a hardcoded string

---

## [1.4.3] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Shutdown confirmation dialog** — Shutdown / Shutdown All open a danger-zone modal requiring a checkbox and typing `poweroff` before powering off ([#22](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/22), [#24](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/24))

### Changed
- **Decode benchmark results** — dropped Server column; show Aggregate + per-stream tok/s

### Fixed
- **Storage tile height jump** — always show disk ↑/↓ I/O rates (`0 B/s` when idle) so multi-disk panels keep a stable height ([#20](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/20), [#23](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/23))

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Free storage** — each disk row in the Storage panel now shows available free space (GB) right-aligned next to used/total, and I/O speeds moved to their own row below

---

## [1.3.9] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Prompt Showcase prompt types** — **Text** / **Structural** / **Mixed** catalogs (mixed interleaves structural and text) so tok/s can be compared by workload shape; type is stored on runs and shown in History
- **Endpoint security posture badge** — per-LLM-panel green / amber / red hint from unauthenticated `/v1/models` (or `/slots`) reachability plus configured probe-host scope (loopback / LAN / public); tooltip does not claim process bind address ([#17](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/17), [#19](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/19))
- **Configurable `BIND_HOST`** — HTTP and WebSocket listen address via env (default `0.0.0.0`); documented for Docker bridge vs host-network / reverse-proxy setups ([#18](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/18))

### Changed
- **Showcase fills max tokens** — each stream requests a full-length generation (`min_tokens` = `max_tokens`, `ignore_eos`, empty `stop`) plus a hard “do not stop early” prompt suffix; retries once without those fields if the backend returns HTTP 400; per-stream timeout raised to 360s for long fills

### Fixed
- **Live showcase tok/s under-count** — live/peak rates counted SSE deltas (often multi-token chunks on vLLM), so terminals showed ~6 tok/s while streaming then jumped to the real ~25 at completion; now estimate from streamed text (~4 chars/token) using the same first→last token window as final decode tok/s

---

## [1.3.4] — 2026-07-27

### Changed
- **Prompt Showcase model header** — model id shown as a prominent centered banner above the metrics strip (removed from the compact title stack under the spark name)
- **Prompt Showcase density** — tighter config fields/inputs/buttons and ~1px smaller base type for more room for the terminal grid

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Prompt Showcase history** — finished runs are archived to disk (`config/showcase-history.json`, last 20 per Spark); History panel to browse, open a past run (read-only terminals), reuse prompts/settings, or clear history
- **Showcase sampling temperature** — **Temp** control (0–2, default 0.7) before Run; validated server-side and applied to chat completions
- **Open Showcase when LLM is offline** — Showcase button remains available on the LLM panel when no model is loaded on the selected port (view history / stage a run)

### Changed
- **Peak tok/s** — per-terminal peak rate, always-visible aggregate and server peak in the metrics strip; peak included in copy-out

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **LLM probe `/slots` 404 spam** — once a backend is known to be vLLM or SGLang, skip the llama.cpp `/slots` re-probe on each detect cycle (still probes on first contact / unknown / llama.cpp). Thanks [@kesslerio](https://github.com/kesslerio) ([#16](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/pull/16), fixes [#15](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash/issues/15))

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-23

Major feature release.

### Added
- **LLM Prompt Showcase** — full-page multi-terminal streaming demo (`/showcase/:sparkId`) opened from the LLM panel
  - Up to **32** concurrent chat streams with curated default prompts; optional prompt editor (“Show prompts”)
  - Dense auto-fit terminal grid, brand chrome in the config bar, Hide/Show controls with peek strip (Stop + aggregate tok/s)
  - Aggregate **tok/s** hero from server `/metrics` during the run (peak, tokens, streams)
  - Copy one terminal or copy all as plain text; collapsible reasoning vs answer styling
  - Thinking-flag adapter (`enable_thinking` vs MiniMax `thinking_mode`, with 400 retry)
  - Ephemeral sessions with heartbeat cancel; mutual exclusion vs DecodeBench (409 both ways)
  - Shared streaming helper extracted for DecodeBench + Showcase (`LlmStreaming.js`)

### Changed
- Mid-run: Port / Terminals / Max tokens / Run locked; Stop stays available
- Changing terminal count after a run clears stale streams and rebuilds the grid

---

## [1.23.2] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Copy results** on the decode benchmark dialog — clipboard plain-text summary (`model | decode tok/s results:` plus per-concurrency decode/server tok/s, optional peak, TTFT; failed rows included)

---

## [1.23.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Local Spark VRAM lag** — Docker Compose sets `pid: host` so `nvidia-smi` compute-apps sees host GPU processes on each poll (parity with remote SSH Sparks)
- **Stale `gpu-memory.json` override** — a successful live compute-apps result (including cleared **0**) is trusted; the host cron file is backup only when live query is unavailable
- **Unified Memory GPU used** — prefer live compute-apps cache over the cron file; fix cache sum using `vramMB`

---

## [1.23.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Centralized metrics history store** (`src/hooks/metricsStore.ts`)
  - Single writer from the WebSocket snapshot path; series keyed by `${sparkId}:${metric}`
  - Caps each series at 1800 samples (~1 h at the default 2 s poll); sparklines read a 30-sample tail
  - Survives Spark tab switches (history no longer lives in per-panel `useState`)
  - Offline Sparks skip ingest so frozen hosts do not drag charts to zero
  - Series: `gpu.usage`, `gpu.temp`, `cpu.usage`, `llm:${port}.tps` (multi-port aware)
  - `useSpark` / `getSpark` selective-subscription seam; orphan series pruned when a Spark leaves the WS list

### Changed
- **GPU/CPU sparklines** — Usage and Temperature charts widened (180px)
- **Spark tab pills** — memoize label + online dot only; drag handle stays outside memo so reorder listeners stay fresh

---

## [1.22.6] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Compact UI** (Settings toggle; persisted as `density: "comfortable" | "compact"`, default comfortable)
  - Applies `data-density` on `<html>` with CSS tokens for shell/header/page/panel/card spacing, root font size, and tighter radius
  - Overview cards, Spark page grid, Panel padding/title margin, and dashboard header gap all follow density tokens
  - Compact mode pins panel/overview `.text-sm` metric text to 14px

---

## [1.22.5] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **vLLM LLM panel row 3** (when `backend === "vllm"`)
  - **Prefix Cache** — lifetime hit rate (`prefix_cache_hits_total` ÷ `prefix_cache_queries_total`)
  - **E2E p95** — end-to-end request latency from `e2e_request_latency_seconds`
  - **ITL p95** — inter-token latency from `inter_token_latency_seconds`
  - **MTP Accept** — speculative decode acceptance (`spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_total` ÷ `spec_decode_num_draft_tokens_total`)
  - Parsed from the same `/metrics` body as existing tiles; tooltips match the row-2 pattern; missing series show **—**

---

## [1.2.2] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Benchmark debug traces** (Settings → **Enable debug traces for Benchmark runs**, default **off**)
  - When enabled, each decode-bench wave persists: full stream **prompts**, HTTP status/headers, SSE **completion IDs**, finish reason, token **usage**, content previews (first/last chars — not full output), and ~1 Hz **GPU** samples (util, temp, power, VRAM)
  - Local Sparks sample fresh GPU metrics during the run; remotes use the live snapshot cache (avoids SSH spam)
  - `config.debug: true` is recorded on jobs that ran with traces on

### Changed
- **Decode benchmark dialog UI**
  - Tighter, more consistent padding on the sheet (header / body / footer)
  - Results shown as denser comparison rows: load/TTFT on the left; **Server** and **Decode** tok/s **right-aligned**
  - Column headers on wider screens; clearer status/progress chrome and legend
  - **Max tokens / stream** stacked like Concurrency (label + hint above a compact input) so the field no longer wraps into a crushed column
  - Max-tokens input value **left-aligned**

### Fixed
- **Worker role flipping to Standalone**
  - API fallback tab snapshots no longer hardcode `role: "standalone"` — they copy role / workerLabel / workerHeadId / llmMonitoring from the registry
  - After Edit/save refresh, live WS metrics are kept but role fields are refreshed from the API
  - PATCH with `role: null` / invalid role no longer clobbers a persisted Worker (normalize would otherwise fall through to Standalone)
  - `workerNode: true` without an explicit role promotes to **Worker**; role strings are trimmed/lowercased
  - Unit tests cover coerce/patch edge cases (`server/sparks/__tests__/role-normalize.test.js`)

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Spark roles** (Edit Spark → **Role**): **Head**, **Worker**, **Standalone** (replaces the Worker-node checkbox)
  - **Head** — cluster head; local LLM always monitored; overview/header show a **Head** badge; MiniStat still shows live **vLLM / model id**
  - **Worker** — no local LLM API (card hidden, ports not probed); optional **Worker label** (cluster/model name) and **Head Spark** picker; overview MiniStat shows **Worker** / label; header shows **Worker** + label badges
  - **Standalone** — normal single-node Spark; optional **LLM monitoring** toggle (default on)
- **Standalone LLM monitoring** — when Role is Standalone, enable/disable probing and the LLM card without making the Spark a worker
- Role badges on Overview cards and Spark header (Head / Worker / Standalone)
- Shared `resolveSparkRole` / `isLlmMonitoringEnabled` helpers (`src/api/sparkRole.ts`)

### Fixed
- **Shutdown “Failed to fetch”** — remote shutdown verifies script/`sudo -n`, then backgrounds so SSH returns before the host dies; only mid-session connection drops count as success; local Sparks acknowledge HTTP **before** power-off; Shutdown All does remotes first, local last
- **Docker image build** — drop flaky second-stage `npm ci --omit=dev`; prune in builder and copy `node_modules`; retry on first `npm ci`
- **Worker → Standalone** — switching role back to Standalone re-enables LLM monitoring (worker had forced it off)

### Notes
- `workerNode` remains derived (`role === "worker"`) for existing probe/card checks; prefer `role` in new code.
- Legacy configs with only `workerNode: true` migrate to role **Worker**.
- Thin alternative to contributor PR #9 (`llmCluster` topology) — same overview/worker UX via `workerLabel` + `workerHeadId`.

---

## [1.1.7] — 2026-07-21

### Added
- **vLLM inference tiles** on the LLM panel (shown only when `backend === "vllm"`):
  - **KV Cache** — usage % from Prometheus (`kv_cache_usage_perc`), colour-coded (green / amber / red)
  - **Requests** — running / waiting counts
  - **TTFT p95** — time-to-first-token 95th percentile from histogram quantiles
  - **Preempts** — cumulative preemption counter
- **Info tooltips** (small “i”) next to each of those four metrics
- Histogram parse/quantile helpers in `LlmProbe` with unit tests (`npm test` → `server/collectors/__tests__`)

### Notes
- Metrics use the same single `/metrics` fetch already used for tok/s (no extra HTTP call).
- ITL p95 was considered and omitted to keep the panel readable; TTFT p95 is the latency signal kept.
- Supersedes contributor PR #11 without personal `docker-compose` SSH mounts or `host.docker.internal`.

---

## [1.1.5] — 2026-07-21

### Added
- **LLM decode benchmark**
  - **Run decode benchmark** on each LLM panel (when a model is available)
  - Multi-select **concurrency** levels (`1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32`); default selection **1, 2**
  - Levels run **one after another**; within a level, N streams fire together
  - Each concurrent stream uses a **distinct JSON/HTML write-style prompt** (higher decode tok/s workloads)
  - Configurable **max tokens per stream** (default **500**, range 64–2048); input allows clearing digits while typing
  - Async jobs: `POST` starts → poll status; one active bench per Spark; cancel supported
  - Results show **Server tok/s** (live-style engine counter samples, same idea as Generation tok/s) and **Per-stream** decode after first token, plus TTFT and stream OK counts
  - Last run **persisted** (`config/bench-history.json`) and restored when reopening the dialog (survives refresh / restart)
  - Mobile-friendly solid sheet (portaled to `document.body`, scrollable body, sticky footer)
- **Remove additional LLM ports** — only non-primary ports show **Remove**; server rejects deleting the first port

### Fixed
- **GB10 GPU used / process list** (unified memory + Docker)
  - Host helper `config/gpu-memory.sh` writes safe JSON: used sum, **MemTotal** as pool size, process list (Python JSON; env-configurable path)
  - `SystemCollector` hydrates process cache from `gpu-memory.json` when in-container `compute-apps` is empty
  - Generated `config/gpu-memory.json` gitignored and no longer tracked
  - Supersedes contributor PR #10 (no machine-specific SSH mounts in compose)
- **Mobile Edit / Add Spark dialogs** — solid max-height sheet, scrollable form, sticky actions, body scroll lock (can reach all fields on phone)

### Notes
- Decode bench hits the real LLM endpoint over LAN; use off-peak for high concurrency.
- Host cron for GPU file (example): `* * * * * /path/to/sparkDash/config/gpu-memory.sh` with `./config` bind-mounted into Docker.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Power management**
  - Per-Spark **Shutdown** and **Wake** controls in the Spark header
  - Overview **Shutdown All** (online Sparks only) and **Wake All**
  - Shutdown runs over SSH: `sudo -n /usr/local/bin/spark-shutdown` (install that script on each host with passwordless sudo for it)
  - Shared Wake-on-LAN helper (`server/wol.js`): MAC validation, `/24` broadcast from LAN IP (fallback `255.255.255.255`), single-settlement UDP send
- **Wake-on-LAN MAC**
  - Auto-detect MAC of the **enP7s7** interface during network polls (local + remote)
  - Persist as `detectedMacAddress` for use when the node is offline
  - Optional **MAC override** in Edit Spark (`macAddress`); Wake uses override → detected → request body
- **Worker node**
  - Edit Spark checkbox **Worker node** (with info tooltip)
  - When set: LLM panels and “Add LLM port” are hidden; LLM ports are not probed
  - **Worker node** badge in the Spark header
- README notes for power controls and LAN trust model for power APIs

### Notes
- Power APIs are unauthenticated like the rest of the dashboard — keep port **5555** on a trusted network only.

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Multiple LLM ports** — monitor several LLM servers on different ports simultaneously (each port gets its own panel and backend detection)
- **GPU processes** — top GPU processes by VRAM usage (name, PID, memory) in the GPU panel
- **Spark uptime** — system uptime badge inline on each Spark header

### Backend (summary)
- `SparkRegistry`: `llmPorts` array with migration from legacy `llmPort`
- `SparkMonitor`: `Map<port, LlmProbe>` for parallel multi-port polling
- `SystemCollector`: process list via `nvidia-smi`
- API: `PUT` / `POST` / `DELETE` LLM port endpoints
